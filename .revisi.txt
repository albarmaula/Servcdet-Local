not using gunicorn

catatan:
For running Flask applications on Windows, you can use the built-in Flask development server 
for development purposes. However, when deploying Flask applications in production on Windows, 
you may need to consider alternative solutions such as using a different WSGI server or deploying 
to a Unix-like environment.
